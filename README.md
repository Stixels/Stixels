### Hi there, fellow nerds! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my humble GitHub abode. I'm Matthew, a.k.a. Stixels, an enthusiastic nerd and software engineer!

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a MERN project, Escape Director, a web app for escape rooms to control and manage their escape rooms. Iâ€™ve also been dabbling with Typescript, NextJS, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, and many others.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate summa cum laude that is passionate about solving problems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Always up for a good collaboration, especially if it involves creative problem-solving and/or the chance to learn something new.
- ðŸ¤” I am currently looking for Software Engineer, Frontend, or Fullstack developer positions.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my latest projects, my journey into the world of web development, or my opinion on the latest games.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via matthewmercado1999@gmail.com â€” always excited to meet fellow code enthusiasts!
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not taming wild codes, you'll probably find me gaming, or working on my next project.

So, strap in and enjoy the journey through my [portfolio](https://www.matthewmercado.dev/) or take a look at my latest project [Escape Director](https://www.escapedirector.com/). Happy coding! ðŸ’»
